Module 1: Introduction to Network Simulator and Sniffing Tool
Q: What is ns-3 and how does it differ from ns-2?
A: ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator designed for research and educational use. Unlike ns-2, ns-3 is written in
C++ and Python, supports real network integration, and provides more accurate simulation models.
Q: Describe the architecture of ns-3.
A: ns-3 architecture consists of core modules for simulation, network protocols, and support libraries. It uses real C++
and Python APIs, event scheduler, and supports internet stack models.
Q: How do you install ns-3 on a Linux platform?
A: Install dependencies (g++, python3, cmake, git, etc.), clone the ns-3 repo, and build using ./build.py.
Q: What is NetAnim Animator?
A: NetAnim is a graphical animation tool used with ns-3 to visualize the network topology, node movements, and packet
flow.
Q: What is PyViz?
A: PyViz is a real-time visualizer tool in ns-3 that helps monitor packet transmissions and node connectivity during
simulation.
Q: What is Wireshark used for?
A: Wireshark is a packet analyzer that captures and inspects network traffic in real-time for protocol analysis and
troubleshooting.
Q: What is tcpdump?
A: tcpdump is a command-line packet sniffer used to capture and display network traffic.
Q: Mention basic Linux networking commands.
A: Commands include ifconfig/ip a, ping, netstat, traceroute.

Module 2: Network Topology
Viva Questions and Answers - Network Simulation and Analysis
Q: What is Point-to-Point topology?
A: It connects two nodes directly using a single link, offering a dedicated path for communication.
Q: What is Bus topology?
A: All devices share a single communication line. Data sent from one node is available to all others.
Q: What is Star topology?
A: All devices connect to a central hub or switch. It?s easy to manage and isolate failures.
Q: Define Mesh topology.
A: Every node connects to every other node, offering high redundancy and fault tolerance.
Q: What is Hybrid topology?
A: It is a combination of two or more basic topologies like star, bus, or mesh.
Q: What is a complex topology?
A: Complex topologies include multiple interconnections and layers, combining various simpler topologies.

Module 3: Basic Network Protocol Models
Q: What is the client-server model?
A: A model where multiple clients request and receive services from a centralized server.
Q: Difference between TCP and UDP?
A: TCP is connection-oriented and reliable; UDP is connectionless, faster but less reliable.
Q: What is FTP and how is it simulated?
A: FTP transfers files over a network. In ns-3, it?s simulated by generating bulk data transfer traffic.
Q: What is DHCP?
A: DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
Viva Questions and Answers - Network Simulation and Analysis
Q: What are other network protocols simulated in ns-3?
A: Protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, ARP, ICMP, and routing protocols can be simulated.

Module 4: Monitoring and Analyzing Network Traffic
Q: How does Wireshark help in protocol analysis?
A: It captures packets in real-time and allows users to inspect each layer of data.
Q: What protocols can Wireshark analyze?
A: It supports HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, UDP, ARP, ICMP, and more.
Q: Difference between TCP and UDP traffic in Wireshark?
A: TCP shows connection setup; UDP appears as individual datagrams.
Q: What is ARP and why is it important?
A: ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for local communication.
Q: What is the purpose of ICMP?
A: ICMP sends error messages like unreachable hosts and echo requests (ping).
Q: What are NAT and SMTP?
A: NAT allows multiple devices to share one public IP; SMTP is used for sending emails.

Module 5: Network Performance Evaluation
Q: What is a flow monitor in ns-3?
A: It records metrics like delay, jitter, throughput, and packet loss during simulations.
Q: How do you evaluate network performance?
A: By analyzing delay, throughput, packet delivery ratio, and loss using tools.
Q: Name tools used for evaluation and animation.
A: FlowMonitor, NetAnim, Pyviz, Wireshark, and custom ns-3 scripts.
Viva Questions and Answers - Network Simulation and Analysis
Q: Why is performance evaluation necessary?
A: It helps identify network issues and ensure QoS requirements are met.

Module 6: Real-Time Network Problem Solving
Q: How do you create a complex network in ns-3?
A: By combining topologies and configuring routers, switches, and IP addressing.
Q: What are congestion control problems?
A: They occur when network traffic exceeds capacity, causing delays and losses.
Q: How does TCP handle congestion?
A: Using Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit, and Fast Recovery.
Q: Compare OMNeT++, QualNet, NetSim, and OPNET.
A: OMNeT++ is open-source; QualNet is fast; NetSim is visual; OPNET is commercial.
Q: What factors influence the choice of simulation tool?
A: Accuracy, UI, protocol support, speed, licensing, and integration.
